# vault

This project is an app that allows its user to generate passwords/secrets  using a key 🔑 that the user set up. That means that the passwords/secrets cannot be accessible without the right key 🔐.
I created this app in order to discover vue3 with typescript and Vite. also to use it personally. If you want to use it ⚠️ use it at your own risk ⚠️
